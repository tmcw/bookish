          Book identifiers are complicated. You might have an ISBN handy, but
          not an ISBN-13 - or one of many other identifers, like those specific
          to goodreads, WorldCat, Amazon, or some other organization.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bookish simply connects IDs to each other. Give it one kind of ID, it
          tries to find all the others.

          Hello, thatâ€™s me, Tom MacWright. I'm an avid reader and I keep track
          of my reading habits on my website. I wanted to switch off of
          goodreads and was frustrated by its reliance on proprietary
          identifiers, and the lack of a universal converter. So I built one.
