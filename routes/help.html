  <p>Book identifiers are complicated. You might
  have an ISBN handy, but not an ISBN-13 - or one of many other identifers,
  like those specific to goodreads, WorldCat, Amazon, or some other
  organization.</p>
  <p>Bookish simply connects IDs to each other.
  Give it one kind of ID, it tries to find all the others.</p>
  <h3>Who made this and why?</h3>
  <p>Hello, that’s me, Tom MacWright.
  I'm an avid reader and I keep track of my reading habits on my
  website. I wanted to switch off of goodreads and was frustrated
  by its reliance on proprietary identifiers, and the lack of a
  universal converter. So I built one.</p>
  <p>The software is composed of two parts: a frontend and a backend.</p>
